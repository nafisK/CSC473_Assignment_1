    <h1>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <h1>I'm Nafis Khan</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>Why did you register for this course?</h2>
    <p>
      I've been on a self-learning journey about web-development for around a
      year now. My goal for enrolling in this class is to be able to formally
      the ins and outs of web-development that I might have missed in my own
      learning process.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What's an interesting fact about you that isn't likely to be true about
      anyone else in the course?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have previous experience with web-dev but I think there may be a lot
      more people with same if not more experience than me. Therefore, if I
      think outside of that, one other big part of my life is fitness and
      something that may be unique to me is that I am able to dumbbell bench
      press 90lbs
    </p>

    <h2>(Optional) Anything else you want me to know?</h2>
    <p>
      I'm excited more about web-development and I'm looking forward to
      improving my CSS and backend skills.
