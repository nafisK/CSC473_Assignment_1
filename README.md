## Assignment 1: Introduce Yourself

## Instructions

Update `index.html` as follows:

- Set the `title` of the page to your name.
- Put your name as an `<h1>` heading at the start of the document
  - (the name you want me to call you)
- Create a `<h2>` heading for each of the following questions and answer the question in a paragraph under the heading:
  - Why did you register for this course?
  - What's an interesting fact about you that isn't likely to be true about anyone else in the course?
  - (Optional) Anything else you want me to know?

### Optional Steps

- Install [pnpm](http://pnpm.io) (or `npm` or `yarn`, I'm just on a `pnpm` kick)
- Run `pnpm install`
- Format your code with [prettier](http://prettier.io) -- no need to install prettier separately, just run `pnpm format`
- Lint your code (check that it's valid HTML) by running `pnpm lint`
